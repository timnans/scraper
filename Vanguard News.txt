Premier League clubs responsible for breakdown of Newcaste takeover ― Staveley
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcAmanda Staveley, the businesswoman at the centre of a Saudi-backed bid to buy Newcastle United, has claimed opposition from other Premier League clubs caused the deal to break down.On Thursday, a consortium led by the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) pulled out of a bid to buy the Premier League club.A proposed £300m purchase, backed by the PIF, whose chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, had been withdrawn – mainly due to the protracted nature of negotiations.Staveley, whose PCP Capital Partners would have taken 10 per cent of the club, with another 10 per cent going to Simon and David Reuben, who are property developers, was at the centre of negotiations.“We are heartbroken obviously,” she told The Times.“Of course we do blame the Premier League. They had a chance, they say we have not answered all the questions and we have done so.“But the other clubs in the Premier League didn’t want it to happen.“We are so heartbroken for the Newcastle fans as the investment that was going to go into the club, especially with everything happening with Brexit and COVID-19, would have been so important. This is catastrophic for them.“It has been going on for so long and the opportunity was there.”A further complication to the deal came after Saudi Arabia were found by the World Trade Organisation to have enabled the piracy of Premier League matches being broadcast by beIN Sport.Staveley, though, insists the hurdle could have been easily overcome.“The piracy issue was not an issue but we tried to resolve it anyway,” she said. “They [the Premier League] tried to make the state of Saudi a director. The PIF had agreed to become a director.”However, Staveley hinted there may be a possibility of reigniting the deal.“Do we give up now? I don’t know, there may be a way forward, but we have had to put a statement out,” she added.“I’m trying to deal with the facts and we had to make a decision today.”FotmobVanguard

Ibrahimovic ‘will kill you’ if do not give your all ― Bennacer
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcZlatan Ibrahimovic is a perfectionist who “will kill” his team-mates if they do not give 100 per cent, according to Milan midfielder Ismael Bennacer.The 38-year-old forward, who rejoined Milan in January, showed once again what he is capable of on Wednesday with two goals and an assist in the 4-1 win over Sampdoria.That took Ibrahimovic’s tally to nine goals in 17 Serie A appearances, helping to propel Milan up to sixth place.Milan director Ricky Massara has confirmed the club are in talks with Ibrahimovic over extending his stay at San Siro beyond this season and Bennacer has hailed the Swedish striker’s dressing room influence.“It’s nice to play with him, of course,” he told Sky Sport Italia. “It helps you to do more – you never want to lose a ball and you give your best, because he seeks perfection.“If he doesn’t find it he will kill you, it’s like that. But for me he is right – it’s better to scream when you do something wrong so you learn and become a high-level player.”Bennacer has been a consistent performer for a Milan side which are unbeaten in 12 games since returning to action last month.The Algeria international has played in 11 of those matches and is hopeful Milan can push on next season and break into the top four.“We are in a European place and it is nice,” he said. “We will try to go to the Champions League next year and to get higher in the standings.“This year I had a lot of fun with this team. We have got much better and it has been the best year for me. I have grown up a lot.”FotmobVanguard

The Buhari international community knows
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcThe Nigerian President is different things to different people, depending on the prism from which he is being considered. To some people, Muhammadu Buhari is a father figure. At 77 years old, he qualifies.To some others, he’s the greatest crowd pulling politician the country has seen for some time, and may yet see for a long time to come. True. And yet, to some others, he’s the strict man of discipline and integrity, who sets his face as flint against all forms of graft and avarice. Very true.President Buhari is all these, and even more. But how does the international community see him? How do leaders of other countries, and people of weight and reckoning see the man who is a gift to the Nigerian nation?For those of us who travel with the President round the world, it is sheer delight to see how the Nigerian Leader is venerated, and held in high esteem by the international community. Never to be forgotten are the words of the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, when he met with President Buhari at the sidelines of the 74th United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States of America, in September, 2019.Inviting the Nigerian President to Euro-African Forum that his country was to host, de Sousa said: “Please come and declare the event open, even if it’s for half a day. We have been waiting for you to visit for three years. Many African leaders have come, but we want Nigeria.”Truly, President Buhari is that Nigerian Leader that is in demand not just in the West African sub-region, where his colleagues virtually compelled him to be Chairman of Ecowas in July 2018, in Africa, where he was made Champion of Anti-Corruption by the African Union (AU), and in the uttermost parts of the world.One of his earliest international visits was to America in July 2015, just two months after assumption of office for the first term. He was guest of the then American President, Barack Obama, who said of him during a bilateral meeting at the Oval Office:“President Buhari came into office with a reputation for integrity and a very clear agenda, and that is to make sure that he is bringing safety and security, and peace to his country.”In September of 2016, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, President Obama said of the Nigerian President again: “I am very pleased that we have been able to build a very strong working relationship with President Buhari, and he’s come in and initiated some very bold efforts at reform.“On the security front, because of President Buhari’s leadership, he has been able to reform the Nigerian military.”What of President Donald Trump, who succeeded Obama in office? At a meeting during an official visit by the Nigerian Leader in April, 2018, he declared: “I especially want to thank President Buhari for Nigeria’s partnership and leadership in the fight against terrorism. He’s been a real leader.”And never to be forgotten is that meeting between Presidents Obama, Buhari, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, during the Nuclear Summit in America in May, 2016.President Obama introduced the Nigerian President to Trudeau, saying; “Have you met President Buhari? He’s doing a good job.”Every good Nigerian felt proud of his President round the world, at that endorsement.Let’s go back in time to London, May 2016. The Queen of England had just turned 90, and after a thanksgiving service, she was in conversation with the then Prime Minister David Cameron, and Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. It was in the build up to a summit on corruption that London was hosting, and unknown to Cameron, a microphone was picking their conversation. He said: “Actually, we have got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain. Nigeria and Afghanistan- possibly two of the most corrupt countries in the world.”But the Archbishop interjected, talking of Buhari. “But this President is not corrupt.”Another fine moment in praise of integrity.President Xi Jinping of the People’s Republic of China: “Under the leadership of Your Excellency, the Nigerian people have been committed to safeguarding the nation’s stabilization, development of economy, and elevation of livelihood and achieved gratifying outcomes.”At another time, President Jinping said: “ President Buhari is as decisive in dealing with terrorism as China.” Thabo Mbeki, former South African President: “Here you have a person whose principle and practice is hostile to corruption. His detention (in 1985) was not for corruption, but for standing against corruption.”Dame Patricia Scotland, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth: “Nigeria’s effort to combat corruption has been awe-inspiring. Thank you, Mr President.”And Rex Tillerson, then American Secretary of State: “President Buhari’s work has resonated across Africa with his recent recognition as the African Union’s anti-corruption champion.” That was in March, 2018.How about a fellow African leader, Dr Hage Geingob, President of Namibia? “A brave son of Africa is here, who has declared war against corruption.”Many other testimonials trail President Buhari from different parts of the world, but this piece won’t be complete without mentioning the inspiring words of the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, about Nigeria’s exploits against the global plague, Covid-19. And it was all under the leadership of President Buhari.“Nigeria is a developing country that has shown a remarkable capacity to respond to the Coronavirus… I was quite impressed to see, for instance, Nigeria putting in place and immediately establishing a hospital. And I saw difficulties in countries that are much more developed to do quickly the same.”Of a truth, Nigeria is blessed to have President Buhari at a time like this. His footprints are surely already left on the sands of time. Indelibly.PRINCE JULIUS ADELUSI-ADELUYI: CELEBRATING AN AFENIFERE AT 80His reputation had preceded him for many decades before I got to meet Prince Julius Adelusi-Adeluyi one-to-one, sometime in 2008.He had been many outstanding things, recorded many firsts, and established a reputation as man for all seasons. Founder of the first company (Juli Pharmacy) promoted by a Nigerian to be listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. First Governor of Rotary Club covering the entire country. When he decided to add a law degree to his original calling as a pharmacist, he came first in law school, despite not being exactly a young man then. First pharmacist to be named Minister of Health in the country. And for me, who lived in Usi-Ekiti when my father was principal at Notre Dame College in the early 1970s, the first Ekiti man who wouldn’t eat pounded yam three times a day. In fact, he does not like pounded yam at all.That day we first met at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), Victoria Island, Lagos, where we had both been invited to the front table during a book launch, I branded the renowned pharmacist in my mind as an Afenifere, though I don’t know if he’s actually a member, or active in the Yoruba socio-cultural and political group, which goes by that name.Who can you really call an Afenifere? Anybody that looks out for your good, and wants to promote it, not necessarily a politician.As we sat together, Prince Adelusi-Adeluyi extracted my life history from me within minutes. When I told him I was Executive Director in charge of Publications at The Sun Newspapers, he was astounded.“Executive Director? But you are too young to be one,” he exclaimed. I laughed, and told him many senior positions I’d held before then. Editor of National Concord. Visiting member of the editorial board at Nigerian Tribune. Editor of Daily Sun for five years.Prince wondered how it all happened, with what he called my “boyish looks.” I told him it was photo trick, and that many decades were already tucked in my belt.That was how a father-son relationship started, which has seen me visiting his home many times, and meeting his dear wife, Julia, who never ceases to “load me with benefits” each time I’m leaving. Incidentally, both don’t look their ages, and carry on like boyfriend and girlfriend.When Prince Adelusi-Adeluyi turned 70, I wrote a piece celebrating him in Daily Sun. All too soon, it’s 10 years after, and he turns 80 on Sunday, August 2, 2020. Hearty congratulations to this caring soul, who is always asking after your family, your welfare, and the next steps, when you finish what you are currently involved in. An Afenifere, if ever there was one.On that very first meeting, as we departed the NIIA after the book launch, he pulled me aside, and in a conspiratorial tone, asked:”And how are the girls,” with a wink. I got the hint, and responded: “No away games sir.” We both laughed.Anytime we meet today, whether in Abuja, or at his Lagos home, he never forgets that question, and the wink. And I try to assure him that I try to be just like him. We laugh.In his early life, the Ado-Ekiti Prince had been a broadcaster at WNBS/WNTV. If you hear him speak today, you will know that what is bred in the bones cannot go out through the flesh. Urbane in all ways.I’m glad President Muhammadu Buhari has celebrated “the accomplished pharmacist, lawyer and boardroom player” with a personal letter, as he turns 80. May we have more men in this mould. But sadly, they don’t seem to make them like this anymore.Congratulations, Prince. In okun o, as the Ekitis would say.*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and PublicityVanguard

Widow raped by policeman: Rivers CP summons suspects, transfers case to SCID
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcPORT HARCOURT—Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, has transferred the case of alleged rape of a 32-year-old widow by a policeman to the State Criminal Investigation Department, SCID.The victim had alleged that Inspector Peter Iba, one of a four-man police team, had raped her throughout Tuesday night “at gunpoint” in a guest house.She said he moved her to the guest house after the team arrested her at Sakpenwan, Tai Local Government Area, for not wearing a nose mask, while in transit on a Port Harcourt-bound vehicle from Bori.CP Mukan, on Thursday, opened investigations into the matter, summoning the four-man police team and the victim, and transferring the case file to the SCID after hearing from both parties.Police spokesman, Rivers Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni, said: “The CP ordered the matter investigated. She (victim) made her statement yesterday (Wednesday) and today (Thursday) we were at Tai Police Station.“Unfortunately, the men that had an encounter with the lady are not from Tai Police Station, as she insinuated. They were, rather, from Mobile Police Base 56 at Bori.“Today (Thursday) all the parties were here. After hearing from them, the matter is being investigated. CP has directed the transfer of case file to SCID for further investigations, at the end of which the report will be made public.“They (suspects) made a lot of denials and confessions, but the investigations will reveal what happened.“Witnesses will be involved, the scene of the crime visited and other things to follow in the course of investigations.”He added that the “accused officers were with the Rivers Police Command. Definitely they will be invited to the SCID and we will keep the public informed.”The raped widow had alleged that the policeman abducted her on Tuesday to a guest house, where he raped her at gunpoint after arresting her for not wearing a nose mask.She said: “I was returning from Bori to Port Harcourt, when I met some police officers at a checkpoint. They arrested me for not wearing a nose mask.“They kept me long there with them. Thereafter, they carried me from one place to the other, claiming they want to take me to the police station, but never took me to any police station.“After some time, they took me to a guest house where one of them raped me till dawn. His name is Inspector Peter Iba of Sakpenwa Police Station.”VANGUARD

Civil Service: Labour battles govt over tenure elongation, irregular appointments
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcABUJA—Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, ASCSN, has taken up arms against Federal Government over irregular appointments and elongation of the tenure of Permanent Secretaries and Directors in the civil service.In a valedictory speech at ASCSN’s 4th quadrennial delegates’ conference, outgoing President of the association, Bobboi Kiagama, among others, noted that “it is disheartening to note that over the years, there has been an upsurge in irregular appointments in the Federal Public Service.“You will recall that recruitment in the Service has always been guided by the Public Service Rules (PSR) 020201-020412. Specific guidelines to be followed are documented and it is not made open-ended.“Unfortunately, we are still having cases of irregular appointments/recruitments into the Federal Public Service, including indiscriminate transfers of persons from the state public services and private sector into the Federal Service without due regard for qualifications, years of experience and hierarchy.“It is so bad that some officers who are appointed to these positions without the requisite qualifications are placed over and above their seniors. This has adversely demoralised the officers that have been compelled to report to their juniors in school and it has impacted negatively on productivity.“We demand that all appointments/recruitments into the Federal Public Service should be done in line with the Scheme of Service, Federal Civil Service Commission Guidelines on Appointment, Promotion and Discipline, Public Service Rules and Establishment Circulars.“This will guarantee equity, fairness and justice as well as restore sanity in the system.”Continuing, Kiagama recalled that “in 2009, the Federal Government introduced tenure policy for permanent secretaries and directors.“The government approved a two-term of four years for permanent secretaries and single eight-year tenure for directors in the federal public service.“The rationale behind the policy was to look for ways to address the age-profile imbalance in the civil service, which had created an unusual situation where deputy directors and assistant directors were retiring ahead of their directors and permanent secretaries some of whom were smuggled into the service at younger ages.“This is because such distortion of recognised standard profiles of age versus grade levels not only makes a mockery of training, deployment and other resources management processes, but portends grave consequences for the future of the civil service.”VANGUARD

Gov Ikpeazu inaugurates 7-member board to manage Enyimba automated shoe factory
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcGov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia on Thursday inaugurated a seven-member board to manage the newly established Enyimba Automated Shoe factory.Speaking during the event in Umuahia, Ikpeazu urged the board to transform “Made in Abia” leather works into a global brand.He described the establishment of the shoe factory as a culmination of the state government’s efforts to mainstream Abia in the competitive global shoe market.“The primary objective for establishing the factory was to create a paradigm shift from the old way of shoe production to promote new dynamics of shoe production with acceptable global standard.“All equipment in the factory are new and of the best in the world and the factory has the capacity to manufacture 5,000 pairs of shoes daily,” Ikpeazu said.The governor urged members of the board to bring to bear their wealth of experience in producing a brand that could compete favourably in the competitive global market.Responding on behalf of the members of the board, Mr Mark Atasie, the Chairman, described the factory as a good foundation that would enable “Made in Abia” leather works to meet international standards.“According to World Bank reports, Aba houses over 100,000 shoe makers and Abia will in no distant time take the lead in the leather and garment sector,” Atasie said.He gave an assurance that the members of the board would be committed, productive, professional and evolve profitable ideas in discharging their duties.The members of the board include, Mr Kito Dominic, Mr Chima Nwafor, Mr Chinenye Nwogu, Miss Ada Asaze, Chief Udeji Udeagbala and Mr Osaro Ekomwererem.Vanguard

Fasanmi’s demise is a great loss to Yorubaland, says South West Govs

He bequeathed courage, planted love and displayed an insatiable quest for a just, equitable and egalitarian Nigeria.“His thoughts were laced with candour and palpable emotional attachment for his people, the Yoruba nation and Nigeria at large.“These thoughts were truly Nigeran and reflected in all ways, an inexorable passion for humanity.“As a true son of the old Ondo State, Governors of both states and indeed, all South West governors, will commence talks with the immediate family to give this patriot, a befitting interment ” he said.Vanguard

Rape: Silence no longer an option — Saraki, others tell victims
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcThe Minister of State for Transportation, Sen. Gbemisola Saraki, on Thursday urged rape victims to speak out, saying that silence was no longer an option if they wanted to get justice.Saraki gave the advice at a webinar on ‘Enforcing Policies and Legal Instruments Against Sexual Harassment and Exploitation in the Maritime Industry’.The webinar was organised by Women in Maritime Journalism (WIMAJ) to commemorate the 2020 Day of the Seafarers.Saraki, who was represented by Mrs Asmau Adaji, Deputy Director, Marine Pollution, Federal Ministry of Transportation, said that the fight against female sexual harassment required effective collaboration of all stakeholders.She said that such stakeholders include government, shipping companies, the media, civil society and the victim who must be courageous to speak up.The minister said that organisations and individuals must shun the culture of silence.“Human dignity must be respected at all times and places, there should be increased protection of women’s rights under the law.“The Federal Ministry of Transportation, with the assistance of maritime agencies, is committed to formulating policies in line with our subsisting law to address this sad phenomenon which erodes human dignity and inhibits the womenfolk from pursuing careers and exploring their potential in the maritime sector,” she said.Saraki said experience had shown that female sexual harassment in the maritime industry remained  largely unreported due to fear of stigmatisation and victimisation.According to her, shipping companies have a role to play in addressing this inhuman practice by publicising the reporting procedures and ensuring the victim’s confidentiality.She said that they must show the commitment to deal with such incidents so as to instil confidence in the victims and deter intending offenders.Also, Mrs Margret Orakwusi, Chairperson, Shipowners Forum, Nigeria, said that there was need to look inward on how women raise the men in their household.According to her, the preferential treatment given to men, raising men to see the female body as an entitlement, is not good at all.She said there was the need to raise men that would appreciate the fundamental rights of a woman.Orakwusi said there was need to encourage people to speak out, as the culture of silence was motivating some men to continue with the bad act.In her contribution, Ms Koni Duniya, ex-seafarer and Voyage Management Advisor, Nigerian LNG, attributed silence by rape victims to the fear of victimisation, shame or isolation on board.She said some could even be afraid of being killed and thrown overboard.Duniya said that cases were also unreported because in terms of evidence collecting, it was almost a lost battle.She said  it was okay to have laws in place, but it was better that the act should not happen at all, advocating zero tolerance to sexual harassment.Mrs Jean Chiazo-Anishere, a lawyer and President, African Women in Maritime (WIMAfrica) said that to curb the menace, there was need to report to bring the perpetrators to book, hence the need to speak out.She urged all women seafarers to ensure that the protection of their bodies and personalities were accommodated in the policy of the companies  they wanted to work with.Vanguard

If you have any COVID-19 symptoms, please call 08001235111 or 08002200110 for assistance.”Vanguard

Gov Sanwo-Olu inaugurates indigenous face mask manufacturing factory
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcLagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday inaugurated the first indigenous face mask manufacturing factory, O-Care Medical Face Mask Factory in Lagos.The factory which is situated at Amuwo Odofin area is primed to produce 240,000 face masks daily.The governor said that the manufacturing of the face masks attested to the “can-do” spirit of Nigerians, while commending the manufacturer for taking such laudable step.He said that the production of the mask by a Nigerian company, Transgreen Nigeria Ltd. was a response to shortage of medical devices that trailed the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.The governor said that his administration was committed to the project and that was why it sent delegates to the factory twice  in the last two months since the idea started.”This is a strategic production and we as a state government will be supporting it, it is a confirmation of what we stand for, creating a favourable atmosphere for business to do well,” he said.While commending the company for bringing the very first production line in medical devices, Sanwo-Olu assured that his government would support the endeavour.He subsequently placed the first order for 250,000 face masks, assuring further that the government would support the company to ensure the face masks were affordable and accessible to the people.Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who gave a goodwill message virtually, also commended the Managing Director of the company, Mr Cyprian Orakpo .”I want to commend you for rising and taking up the challenge between the months of May and July to solve the problem of shortage of medical devices occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19.”Between May and June, you achieved this feat, it was done in record time, I wish you many more successes ahead,” Osinbajo said.Earlier, Orakpo said that he decided to take up the challenge of going into the production when in the wake of the outbreak of the pandemic there was shortage and scarcity of medical devices all over the world.”Respiratory hygiene has taken a centre stage in curbing the spread of this contagious disease. Wearing a face mask has become the new normal.”Transgreen Nigeria Ltd. has been up to the occasion to fill this void and contribute its quota in fighting this pandemic and to promote health security in the country and world at large,” he said.According to him, O-Care Medical Face Mask Factory is the first certified and registered medical face mask manufacturer in Nigeria and indeed, sub-Saharan Africa.He said that apart from face mask, the company also manufactured other medical devices such as gloves, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), respirators, ventilators, among others.”O-Care Medical Face Mask is a 3-Ply face mask that offers protection against dust, pollen, bacteria and all known viruses with breathable comfort and low respiratory resistance. This product is durable and manufactured to WHO standards.”The first or outermost layer called hydrophobic non-woven layer protects the wearer from droplets and splashes.”The middle layer called meltblown is the filter against bacteria and viruses while the innermost or skin layer is a soft fabric/tissue that is comfortable to the skin,” Orakpo said.Vanguard

Ogoni Cleanup: We’re shocked HYPREP is unknown to law ― Ogoni Youths
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcYOUTHS in oil devastated Ogoniland, Rivers State, have expressed shock and apprehension over the recent judgement of a Federal High Court in Port­-Harcourt which declared the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), in charge of the Ogoni Cleanup, as “unknown to law” and can’t sue or be sued.The plaintiff in the case, Ogoni Youth Federation (OYF) in a joint statement by the National Youth Council of Ogoni People (NYCOP) in Port Harcourt on Thursday said the judgement portends danger for the Ogoni people if a body entrusted with millions of dollars to clean Ogoniland cannot be questioned while also harping on the imperative to back HYPREP by law.Ogoni Youth Federation (OYF) relying on the Freedom of Information Act in the suit against HYPREP had approached the court to compel HYPREP to be accountable on how initial $10 million Federal Government take-off grants for the Ogoni Cleanup was being disbursed.Presiding Justice Emmanuel Obile who struck out the case on technical grounds in the July 17 ruling had declared that HYPREP could not be sued because it was not established by an Act of the National Assembly, asserting that the plaintiffs filed the suit wrongly as they did not follow the right judicial process.Legborsi Yamaabana, President-General, OYF, in a joint briefing with Young Nkpah, NYCOP, said, “That a team managing whopping $1 billion of Ogoni fund is not known to the law is shocking. We are beginning to understand why HYPREP is failing to implement the UNEP report with impunity on the Ogoni Cleanup.“It means they are free to do whatever they like and go away with it. That is why the community complaints and protest are falling into deaf ears. We are happy the case was not dismissed but struck out on a technicality. We are definitely appealing the judgement to sue the right parties.Nkpah of NYCOP said: “The lesson from the shocking court ruling is that Federal Government must urgently back HYPREP by an Act of Parliament, otherwise any government can come up any day to scrap it and we are back to square one.”On perceived failures of HYPREP on the Ogoni Cleanup, Nkpah said: “Where are the emergency measures UNEP recommended to restore livelihoods in the polluted communities before considering Cleanup and remediation? They did bidding for water in 2018. They are doing another now, yet no water has been provided.“The people are still drinking polluted water and you say you are cleaning Ogoniland. Besides, what are you cleaning when oil theft still thrives? More pipes being broken and pollution still persist. They cannot deceive us.“We know how companies specialised in animal husbandry and tailoring are being listed to do Cleanup. When you confront them they say they have foreign technical partners. They are digging and re-digging where there are no pollutions. No Cleanup is happening.”Among their expectations, youths of Ogoniland insist on the sack of HYPREP Coordinator, Marvin Dekil and replacement with another Ogoni indigene, the establishment of independent monitoring and evaluation team on the Cleanup as well as a sack of the communications team at HYPREP over communication gap between Ogoni people and the agency.They further demanded, “Review of the profile of HYPREP contractors over casualisation scheme for employed Ogoni youths in violation of Labour Laws. Ogoni youths are neither paid evenly nor given employment letters even after one year. This trend must be reversed.“HYPREP office must relocate from Port Harcourt to Ogoniland for proximity to the people, project sites and for direct impact on the local economy. Allied industries would also take advantage of the favourable investment climate offered by the Ken Saro Wiwa Polytechnic, Kira Campus as well as the Mobile Police Force, Squadron 56 Barracks in the area for security and sustainability.“Dissolution of HYPREP’s Governing Council, Board of Trustees, and the resignation of all Ogoni representatives on both organs (where currently outnumbered) to pave way for fresh negotiations and redesign of the operational structure of the project, without manipulations from Shell and Partners, to achieve set objectives of the UNEP Report.”Vanguard

AMCON vs POON N58bn loan dispute: We’re yet to settle, parties tell court
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcThe parties in N58.9billion loan dispute between Pan Ocean Oil Corporation Nigeria Limited (POON), its affiliate companies and Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON) have told a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos that they have not been able to agree on terms of settling out of court.Lead counsel for the firms, OAR Ogunde (SAN) and his AMCON counterpart, Kunle Ogunba (SAN) told Justice Mohammed Liman, the development at the last hearing.“We have not gotten any feedback that the matter has been settled and therefore intend to proceed with our motion,” Mr Ogunde, SAN told the court, adding that the claimant/respondent had not shown any concrete step towards settlement.He informed the court that the order obtained by AMCON was executed against third parties, who had been sent out of the sealed properties.“If the claimant can be restricted, then this will encourage us to wait for settlement because they are expensive buildings and can attract thieves if left unoccupied,” he submitted.Mr Ogunde SAN also stated that the liability of third parties would affect his clients and request for an undertaking that would allow them to regain possession of their respective properties.In his response, Mr Ogunba, SAN said that the interest of his client should not be jeopardised in the process. “The decision with respect to the proposal on a settlement cannot be taken in a day. It needs time. If third parties are aggrieved, they know what to do.“The defendant has a legion of companies, which they operate. We have put a system in place to attend to affected third parties. One of them is Saipem Contracting Nig Ltd, who wants to leave and we have instructed them to write to us,” Ogunba, said.After listening to both counsel, Justice  Liman stated that it was improper to drive tenants out and then begin to listen to them. “It is a bullet approach which is wrong. Once possession is taken, you serve tenants notice and not to drive them out,” he said, adding that there was no justification for AMCON’s action.He held that the tenants should be allowed to enjoy their tenancies with the option to retain or renew a tenancy, maintaining that third parties should not be prejudicially affected.Counsel for one of the tenants, Saipem, Mr Olugbenga Onalaja informed the court that he had written to Ogunba (SAN), seeking to be allowed to go into the property to take out its assets since its tenancy had expired. The court, therefore, struck out the notice of claim filed by Saipem, saying that it had been overtaken by events. The judge also discharged all the banks that filed an affidavit indicating that the firms had no account with them.However, Ogunde SAN, informed the court that its ex-parte order was harming the defendants. “Our application is ripe for hearing. All the accounts of defendants have been frozen, even accounts of POON, Beam and Trensix on which the orders of court executed in this suit did not cover.He further stated that his client’s operations of crude oil was been hampered. That up till that day, the defendants had no access to one dollar as all monies went into an account controlled by AMCON and the banks.“If things are not managed well, oil and gas production will cease. We have been paying despite being in court. How can we continue to pay when the account has been frozen? These issues are mitigating against the settlement. There was no point freezing the accounts. People who should be paid are not paid as a result”, he declared.Consequently, the judge advised the lawyers to work through the process of settlement and take interest of parties into consideration. “I am aware that the actions of the receiver may affect the fiscal policy of the country. The receiver also has a judiciary duty to protect. It is not for the court to set criteria for parties, you do that yourself,” Justice Liman said and adjourned to October 13, for the report of settlement. The judge noted that if parties did not settle during vacation, they were at liberty to approach the vacation judge to argue any issue that they considered urgent or important.Vanguard

Sallah: Buhari lauds Muslims, Christians for understanding on COVID-19 guidelines
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcPresident Muhammadu Buhari has commended the sacrifices of Muslims and Christians in abiding by the COVID-19 guidelines for the good of society.Malam Garba Shehu, the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, disclosed this in a statement in Abuja on Thursday.He said that Buhari gave the commendation in his Sallah message to Muslims on the occasion of Eid-el-Kabir celebration.Buhari assured Nigerians that, “On our own part, we shall continue to provide economic reliefs to the people to minimize the unintended hardships these guidelines have inflicted.’’The president reminded worshippers that COVID-19 is worldwide affliction with Churches and Mosques closed and social distancing imposed to safeguard public health.He, therefore, reiterated his call on Nigerians to continue to exercise patience and understanding over the inconveniences created by the precautionary measures taken, especially the regulations on places of worship.He said the outbreak of coronavirus had made it ”difficult for people to gather in places of worship as they are used to”, urging worshipers to follow the guidelines for the safety of their lives and loved ones.“The coronavirus has had devastating adverse impacts on our social, economic and spiritual lives.“The preventive guidelines we have introduced to contain the spread of this deadly disease have unfortunately limited people’s freedom to gather and worship in large numbers in  Mosques and Churches.“Every measure that has been introduced to contain this disease may have its unintended consequences on the daily lives of our people, and I, therefore, call on Muslims and other faiths to continue to show more understanding with the government as we take correct steps to protect our people through the social distancing.“No elected government would intentionally take away its people’s religious freedom by limiting the number of people that will gather in worship centres at the same time.“These guidelines are dictated by necessity in order to safeguard public health and should therefore not be perceived as infringement on people’s right to worship,’’ he said.While wishing Muslims a happy celebration, the President called on worshipers not to forget the symbolic significance of the sacrifices of the Eid-el-Kabir.“Muslims should imbibe the noble virtues of our great prophets in order to establish closer connectivity between religious teachings and practice.“We can create the greatest impact by putting into practice the noble teachings of our religion. In whatever we do in life, we must put the fear of God in our daily activities in order to make our society better.’’The president reminded the people of his efforts to root out corruption in the country, stating that the efforts had so far brought a lot of changes in country.He, therefore, appealed for support and understanding as ”investigations are carried out into both legacy cases and fresh cases”.Vanguard

How police officer raped me till dawn for not wearing nose mask, widow narrates
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etc HUMAN rights defender, Prince Wiro, on Wednesday charged the Police Command in Rivers State to investigate and prosecute its personnel accused of raping a woman for breach of COVID-19 protocol.The victim, a 32-year-old widow, said a policeman attached to the Sakpenwa Police Division, Tai Local Government Area, allegedly abducted her Tuesday to a guest house where he raped her at gunpoint after arresting her for not wearing a nose mask.She narrated: “I was returning from Bori to Port Harcourt when I met some police officers at a checkpoint. They arrested me for not wearing a nose mask. They kept me long there with them.“Thereafter they carried me from one place to the other, claiming they want to take me to the police station, but never took me to any police station.“After some time, they took me to a guest house where one of them raped me till dawn. His name is Inspector Peter Iba of Sakpenwa Police Station.”Prince Wiro, in response to the allegations, demanded the Police Command in the state to, “Open immediate investigation into the alleged rape of this woman by a serving officer.“There is no justification for the punishment of rape to be meted out to a woman because she flouted Rivers State Government order on the use of nose masks. I expect the police to take this matter seriously.“You know there’s a recent order from the Inspector General of Police charging every Command to do everything possible to make rape a thing of the past in the society.”The victim had on the spur-of-the-moment on Tuesday raised alarm in a text message posted on a WhatsApp media platform where she lamented, “I have been taken to a guess house just because of N100 face mask.“I can’t believe this is happening to me. He wants to sleep with me. I am dying. He wouldn’t let me pick any call. He threatened to seize my phone.”The Police Command in the state reacting to the allegation through the Police Public Relations Officer, Rivers Command, Nnamdi Omoni, said: “After hearing about this, we immediately invited the lady. After hearing from her, she made a written statement and Investigation has commenced.”Vanguard

If military can’t clear Baga, we will mobilise hunters, vigilantes ― Gov Zulum
A Nigerian newspaper and Online version of the Vanguard, a daily publication in Nigeria covering Nigeria news, Niger delta, general national news, politics, business, energy, sports, entertainment, fashion,lifestyle human interest stories, etcThe Borno State governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has pointed an accusing finger at the Military in Baga Town, where his convoy was attacked, saying that if the military will not clear Baga, his government will mobilise local hunters, CJTF, and vigilantes to recapture the town as they cannot fold their hands and keep waiting.Addressing journalists, Governor Zulum insisted that the presence of troops in Baga in the last two years is a shame and unacceptable.The governor, who was in the volatile town of Baga on an assessment visit to see how residents will return to their town, had to be whisked into the Federal Anti-Robbery Squad, FSARS, personnel armoured carrier and sneaked out of the town.Speaking on the Baga attack on his convoy, while in Monguno, Governor Zulum said: “As far as I am concern, what happened in Baga is complete sabotage by the military. There is no Boko Haram in Baga.“I wondered; we have over 1,181 soldiers in Baga: 72 officers, 107 soldiers, 400 soldiers in Mile 4 and 1900 soldiers in Monguno. I see no reason why only five Boko Haram terrorists stop them from occupying Baga town.”He noted that “the troops have been in Mile 4 for over one year. There is complete sabotage; the problem is not with President Buhari or General Buratai, but the command and control structure is nothing to write home about. There is a need to look into the command structure.“We have over 80,000 IDPs in Monguno. They cannot continue to depend on International Non-Governmental Organizations, INGO, and others for food. We have to create an opportunity for them to go back to their communities and continue with their business and farming activities.“After Sallah, we are going to allow people to go back to Kukawa and we will give time to the military. If they will not clear Baga, we will mobilise our hunters, CJTF, and vigilantes to recapture Baga. We cannot continue like this. People have to take their destiny in their hands.”Vanguard News Nigeria
