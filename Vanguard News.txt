OSHIOMHOLE INSULTED ME IN 2016 BECAUSE HE WAS MARKETING BAD PRODUCT, SAYS IZE-IYAMU
The All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate in the forthcoming Edo State governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said the former governor of the state, Adams Oshiomhole, called him names in 2016 because he (Oshiomhole) had a bad product (Governor Godwin Obaseki) to market.Speaking to Vanguard in an interview, Pastor Ize-Iyamu noted that it was necessary for Oshiomhole to “throw punches” at him, adding that people had a short memory, because the same Oshiomhole had, at several fora, shown appreciation for his integrity and contribution to Edo State’s development.Asked about the 2016 spat, Ize-Iyamu said: “If during the campaigns for the 2016 governorship election he was abusing me because I was on the other side, what do you expect?“Of course, he needed to abuse me, especially when he didn’t have a good product (Obaseki). You can imagine how Governor Obaseki started his campaign for the forthcoming election.”Ize-Iyamu added: “They placed a big screen on Ring Road in Benin, where everybody passes. One would have thought that all he would be playing on that kind of screen are his administration’s achievements in the last four years.“Instead of that, he is playing something about the Governor of Kano State. It was when condemnation came from within and outside Nigeria that they had to stop it.“What has the governor of Kano State got to do with the governorship election in Edo State apart from being the chairman of APC National Campaign Council?“Yes, Oshiomhole threw punches at me in 2016, but people tend to have a short memory. Oshiomhole was at Ben Idahosa University, when I was being given a doctorate and he spent over one hour praising me for my contributions in his government and the role I am playing in the state.“Oshiomhole also came to my farm at one time, when I was graduating students and he listed the roles I was playing in the state.“At my 50th birthday, there was no word he didn’t use to describe me, including the fact that if he wants to mention those who have helped him to succeed in government, there is no way my name will not be there.“I am sure that those who had gone through campaigns before will tell you that people will call their opponents all sorts of names during electioneering campaigns, but if you allow those things to border you, they will distract you.”VANGUARD

LAGOSIANS BEG SANWO-OLU TO SUSPEND LAGBUS FARE HIKE
Some commuters in Lagos State have appealed to Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu to reverse fares hike approved for Lagos Bus Service Ltd (LBSL) considering economic hardship facing the masses.Recall  that the LBSL, operator of the Marcopolo high-capacity buses in Lagos, had announced that the state government had given approval for an average of 46 per cent hike in fares with effect from Aug. 1.About 24 hours to implementation of the new fares, some residents of the state urged the governor to consider negative impact of COVID-19 on income, wages and salaries of the masses.According to them, though the increase may be justifiable considering the economic realities, the state government can bridge the gap so as not to compound sufferings of people who rely much on LBSL.Mr Godfrey Gabriel, a regular user of the bus from Ikeja Terminal to Obalende, told NAN that government must consider the millions of workers whose jobs, salaries and wages had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.Gabriel said that no matter how justifiable the reason for the upward review of the fares was, the steps was not good at the time considering the sufferings of the people.He said: “As a regular user, I want to say the increase is justifiable to be fair, the firm has tried for Lagosians but I think it is coming at a wrong time.“We are in a very difficult situation in Lagos and Nigeria in general at the moment when life is so difficult for most people, especially the struggling masses.“Employers are cutting salaries because of the effect of the COVID-19, commuters who earn little pay now to keep body and soul together are spending more money. Money is not coming, so economically the state is down, individuals are down.“Increasing fares now will aggravate the sufferings of the masses. Where does the government want the poor, whose purses force them to queue for hours just to board buses that is cheap, get the money from.”Miss Janet Osinimu, a private school teacher, urged the government to rescind its decision in the name of God and the suffering masses.Osinimu, a Mathematics teacher, said: “Sanwo-Olu should pity us. There is hardship in the land. If the rich are complaining, the governor should know what the poor are going through.“There is a high level of unemployment, most of us are managing. As a private school teacher, I received full salary last in February.“The March salary was half payment. So many have also got reduction in their salaries. We need assistance at this time not a step that will multiply hardship,” she said.Miss Abimbola Daniel, a House Mistress in a private school, described the upward review of fares as increasing the hardship of the people.“It will be good if the government tell the LBSL to be patient for this period of global pandemic to be over. We will support any increment then.“The government can intervene and come in, bridge the gap for this period to be over instead of compounding hardship of the people whose interest you sworn to protect.“It is a public service initiative, we expect the government to bailout the masses from this hardship.“If the company is running at a loss, let the government provide a grant for the company for the sake of people to cushion the effect so that the firm will not go down,” Daniel said.Mr Ayo Alade, an ICT expert, said that the service should be in public interest and should be there to serve the people, hence there was no need for the increase, especially at this time when people were under heavy financial burdens. Vangaurad

Kuiper will change that. Our $10 billion investment will create jobs and infrastructure around the United States that will help us close this gap.”Project Kuiper seeks to deliver high-speed broadband service to places beyond the reach of traditional fibre or wireless networks, including disaster relief.It will be aimed at individual households, as well as schools, hospitals, businesses and other organizations.An Amazon statement said the project also aims to “deliver an affordable customer terminal that will make fast, reliable broadband accessible to communities around the world.”Kuiper is one of several projects to deliver internet from space begun over the past decades.Elon Musk’s SpaceX and British-based OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, are working on similar projects.[AFP]Vanguard News Nigeria.

MURIC BLAMES PARENTS FOR SURGE IN RAPE CASES
An Islamic group, Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, has blamed the spike in rape cases across the country on poor parental upbringing.According to the religious body, any society where male children are not taught to respect the opposite sex will face mounting incidence of rape.MURIC stated this in a Sallah message through its Executive Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola, signed and sent to journalists on Friday.He noted that one of the major reasons for the preponderance of rape is the failure of parents to guide their children.The statement reads, “In particular, many parents fail to teach their male children how to respect the other sex.“They, therefore, grow up treating women and girls like underdogs. Consequently, most young boys commit rape without knowing the implications.“Parents need to properly tutor them to respect women and girls and to know the legal implication of rape.“Nigerians should borrow a leaf from the lessons of Id al-Kabir and from Islam in general. If all Nigerian parents tutor their children the way Prophet Luqman (peace be upon him) did in Qur’an 31:13 – 19, our youths will be better guided.“Luqman told his son to ‘enjoin righteousness and forbid evil’. Rape is evil. It is an act of wickedness. It is barbaric.“In the same vein, Prophet Ismail (PBUH) obeyed his father even when his father informed him that Allah commanded him to sacrifice his son.“He told his father, ‘Do what you’re told. So, you will see that I am one of those who are patient’ (Glorious Qur’an 37:102 – 103).”Meanwhile, Akintola stressed that rape will drastically be reduced if parents tutored their children properly. Above all, if children follow the instructions.Vanguard

Even during this festive period, religious leaders have a role to play in this regard, sharing and eating of ram is goodbut we should be conscious of danger of crowding together.“With the easing of lock down, we have to emphasis on compulsory use of facemasks. The issue of face mask is something that we have talked about severally. Apparently, people are yet to get the fact that the use of face mask is extremely important as far as prevention is concerned.
